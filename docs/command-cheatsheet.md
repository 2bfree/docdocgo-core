# Command Cheatsheet

You can enter your messages with or without a prefix. Different prefixes activate different response modes.
By default, if a message is entered with no prefix, the `/docs` mode is used.

Here's what each prefix does:

- `/docs`: chat about your currently selected document collection (general topics are also ok)
- `/details`: get details about the retrieved documents
- `/quotes`: get quotes from the retrieved documents
- `/web`: perform web searches and generate a report
- `/research`: perform iterative research (no message = iterate on previous report)
- `/chat`: regular chat, without retrieving docs or websites
- `/db`: manage your document collections (select, rename, etc.)
- `/help`: show a help message (similar to this cheatsheet)

Example query: `/research what special medical needs do cornish rexes have?`.

If you're in a reading mood, here's a [link to the full docs](https://github.com/reasonmethis/docdocgo-core/blob/main/README.md).

You can also ask DocDocGo for help with using it. By default, it's set up to use the `docdocgo-documentation` collection, which contains its docs. As long as this collection is selected (as shown in the chat box), it should be able to handle most of your questions about how to use it.
