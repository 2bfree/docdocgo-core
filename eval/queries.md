/research I'm looking for a tutorial on configuring Firestore (not Firebase) so that my external server-side application can use it. Most importantly, I want to know exactly how to set up the right role to the service account. Please assign a score 0-100 to each website for how well it fulfills that purpose. The tutorial should not be from Google's docs and they should not be about Firebase, only regular Firestore. If it's from Google's docs or mentions Firebase, assign score 0. Please just assign a score to each source and add a one-two sentence description, nothing else. Include links. If your prompt includes a previous report with assessments, keep them in your current report
/research Please find quotes by Noam Chomsky about the scientific or practical value of ChatGPT. For each quote include a link to the source
