How had I not thought of it before?  The recipe for chocolate salami is as easy as it is genius.  Made with cookie crumbs and chunks mixed with nuts, butter, sugar, milk, and cocoa, when sliced, it looks just like a piece of salami.  Now picture it on a pretty wooden board with sweet crackers, fruits, and maybe even a chocolate chip dip (https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/chocolate-chip-dip/) !   2. Bird’s Milk Cake (https://www.alyonascooking.com/birds-milk-cake-recipe-ptichye-moloko/)  Using sour cream as the main ingredient had me a little skeptical, but this cake is delicious.  With a light, thin, sweet milk-soaked cake as a base,

EDITOR’S NOTE: Traveleater Elise Ofilada shares with us 20 traditional Polish desserts that you need to try on your next visit to Krakow and Poland.  Located in the heart of Europe, Poland is a hidden gem for Traveleaters who want to thoroughly experience the continent’s Slavic culture. Though many people remember the country for its tumultuous history or its strong reverence for the Roman Catholic religion, it also boasts an abundance of scenic places to visit and explore.  Poland is home to seventeen UNESCO World Heritage Sites (https://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/pl) , after all, such as the must-see Wieliczka Salt Mine and the very quaint Historic Centre of Kraków. On top of that, by the coast of the Baltic Sea, Poland’s beaches are perfect spots to spend an afternoon while basking in the view of the horizon.  Cuisine-wise, Poland’s most well-known dish is called pierogi, which are dumplings often stuffed with savory fillings. When it comes to desserts, however, there’s no doubt that Poles prefer some sweetness instead.  Rivaling the desserts of its more famous neighbors, like Germany (https://www.willflyforfood.net/german-food/) and Russia, in terms of decadence, Polish desserts are a must-try for Traveleaters of all nationalities.   POLISH DESSERTS QUICK LINKS  If you’re visiting Poland and want to learn more about Polish food, then you may be interested in joining a food tour or taking a cooking class.

Babka  Commonly enjoyed during Easter Sunday (https://gjcookies.com/news/2016/03/28/everything-youve-ever-wanted-to-know-about-babka) , babka is a sweetened, bread-like cake that can be made in a variety of flavors (https://www.polishyourkitchen.com/?s=babka) . Developed by Polish Jewish communities in the 19th century, it has been described as similar to brioche, panettone, and Bundt cake.

Plus, taking the time and attempting to try them guarantees that they are made with lots of love, right?  Take a break from your usual chocolate cakes and sugar cookies and try some of these traditional treats from Poland!   1.  Kołaczki: Polish Cream Cheese Cookies  These vibrant and colorful cream cheese cookies make me giddy and happy! My guests are just as thrilled, too, because these are so delicious!  The kołaczki is called a cookie, but it’s buttery and flaky.  There’s really no need to get into the complexities of whether it’s really a cookie or a pastry, because the only info you need is that it tastes good.  There are a lot of filling options to choose from, like berries, nuts, or even cheese.  It can get a little overwhelming, but that’s also what makes it such a hit with the crowd. Everybody loves options.   2. Polish Coffee Cake  It’s always exciting to try someone’s family recipe, especially one that has been passed down from generation to generation!  Try this Polish version of coffee cake. This recipe is an interesting take on coffee cake because it uses yeast. Don’t be intimidated because the waiting is the only hard part here.  Once you’ve tried this, you won’t be able to forget the taste and crunch of the heavenly crumb topping that perfectly offsets the soft and moist cake.   WANT TO SAVE THIS RECIPE?

Szarlotka: Apple Tart  The Szarlotka can best be described as the less sweet cousin of the American apple pie.  Let’s just say she’s the mature one who need not try too hard. You can totally enjoy this delicious Polish treat without having to worry about the sugar!  You can also whip this up if you have something come up last minute.  This apple tart only uses pantry ingredients along with granny smith apples, so you’re basically good to go anytime.   4.
