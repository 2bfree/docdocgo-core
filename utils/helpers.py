ðŸ¦‰**Hi, I'm DocDocGo!** I can chat with you like ChatGPT, and also can:
- research a topic on the web and write a report
- keep fetching more sources and rewriting the report iteratively
- answer follow-up questions using all the sources as a knowledge base
- answer questions about documents you provide

For more details you can jusk ask me! (or type `/help`) \

- `/db` (to manage your *collections*, i.e. the knowledge bases we've created)

HELP_MESSAGE = f"""\
### What I can do

- **Answer questions** about documents you provide.
    - Documents are organized into **collections**
    - The chat box shows which collection is currently used for my answers
- **Research a topic** on the web and generate a report
    - I can keep researching more and more sources and improving my report iteratively.
    - I **save sources** in a new doc collection, so you can ask me questions about them.

### How to use me

You can enter your messages with or without a prefix. Different prefixes activate my different \
response modes. Think of them like different subagents, each with a different job. \
The default mode is `{DEFAULT_MODE}`.

Here's what each prefix does. Most important prefixes:
- `/ingest` or `/upload`: upload your documents and ingest them into a collection
- `/research`: perform iterative Internet research (no message = iterate on previous report)
- `/docs`: chat with me about your currently selected doc collection (or a general topic)
- `/db`: manage your doc collections (select, rename, etc.)

Other prefixes:
- `/help`: show this help message
- `/details`: get details about the retrieved documents
- `/quotes`: get quotes from the retrieved documents
- `/web`: perform web searches and generate a report
- `/chat`: regular chat, without retrieving docs or websites

Example queries: 
- `/research What are this month's most important AI news?`
- `/research` (to fetch more websites and iterate on the previous report)
- `/docs Bullet point for me just the ones related to OpenAI`
- `/db` (to manage collections)

If you're in a reading mood, here's a [link to my full docs]\
(https://github.com/reasonmethis/docdocgo-core/blob/main/README.md).

Or simply ask me for help! By default, I'm set up to use the `docdocgo-documentation` \
collection. As long as it's selected in the chatbox below, I'll know how to use me.

> If you need to switch to the default collection, type `/db use docdocgo-documentation`.
"""

DB_COMMAND_HELP_TEMPLATE = f"""\
Your current document collection is: `{{current_db}}`

You can use the following commands to manage your collections:
- `/db list`: list all your collections
- `/db use my-cool-collection`: switch to the collection named "my-cool-collection"
- `/db rename my-cool-collection`: rename the current collection to "my-cool-collection"
- `/db delete my-cool-collection`: delete the collection named "my-cool-collection"

Here are some additional shorthands:
- `/db use 3`: switch to collection #3 in the list
- `/db delete --current` (or just `-c`): delete the current collection

Remember, you can always ask me for help in using me - you just need to make sure that \
the default collection (`{DEFAULT_COLLECTION_NAME}`) is selected.
